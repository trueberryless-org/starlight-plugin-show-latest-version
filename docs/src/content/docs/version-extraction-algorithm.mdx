The Starlight Plugin Show Latest Version plugin fetches the latest release of the repository on GitHub specified in the [`repo` configuration option](/configuration/#repo). It than extracts the `tag_name` which is the equivalent to the title of the release as you can see it on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/trueberryless-org/starlight-plugin-show-latest-version/releases).
