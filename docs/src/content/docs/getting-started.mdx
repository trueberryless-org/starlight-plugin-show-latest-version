Add a nice credit to Starlight or Astro at the bottom of Table of Contents.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. `starlight-cooler-credit` is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

    <TabItem label="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install starlight-cooler-credit
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add starlight-cooler-credit
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add starlight-cooler-credit
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

    ```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
    +import starlightCoolerCredit from 'starlight-cooler-credit'

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        starlight({
    +      plugins: [starlightCoolerCredit()],
          title: 'My Docs',
        }),
      ],
    })
    ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the plugin in action.

</Steps>

The Starlight Cooler Credit plugin behavior can be tweaked using various [configuration options](/configuration).
