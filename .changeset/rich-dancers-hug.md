⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** If you set [`showInSiteTitle`](https://starlight-plugin-show-latest-version.trueberryless.org/configuration#showinsitetitle) to `"deferred"`, you will have to enable [experimental sessions](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/sessions/) because the version will be cached for an hour.
