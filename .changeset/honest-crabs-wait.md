"starlight-plugin-show-latest-version": patch
---

Make override of Starlight `SiteTitle.astro` optional. You now have to opt-in by setting the new [`showInSiteTitle`](https://starlight-plugin-show-latest-version.trueberryless.org/configuration/#showinsitetitle) configuration option to `"true"` because it does not get overridden by default.
